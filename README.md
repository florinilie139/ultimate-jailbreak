# Ultimate Jailbreak Manager 
(plus some jailbreak related plugin compilation)

Author: Florin Ilie aka (|Eclipse|) & others

## Introduction
I've have been writing plugins for the Jailbreak mod for around 10 years and since there is no intended plan to work on this anymore and I don't want my work go to waste, I have publish this so other can learn and use it if they want to

## Credits
To my friends David for being the Co Owner of the server, Dumnezeu/Mr.Sergian for providing code implementations in my absence and for all the users and admins who were part of the multiple iterations of the servers on which my plugins were running.

## Plan for the future
I don't intend to update, fix or change anything! This is a direct upload of my workspace that I kept saving for a long time and it is messy! If you see your plugin here and you don't want it to be part of it, I will gladly remove it.
If you have any fixes or suggestions, feel free to do a pull request and I will try to approve it!

Have fun learning and keep coding!
